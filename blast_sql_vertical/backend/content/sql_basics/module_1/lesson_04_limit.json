This is useful when you only need a sample of the data or the top N results.\n\n### Syntax\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name\nLIMIT n;\n```\n\n### Combining with ORDER BY\n\nA common pattern is to get the \"top 3\" of something by combining `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM products ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 3;\n```\n\nThis returns the 3 most expensive products.",
