Only rows that satisfy the condition are returned.\n\n### Syntax\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name\nWHERE condition;\n```\n\n### Comparison operators\n\n- `=` Equal\n- `!=` or `<>` Not equal\n- `>` Greater than\n- `<` Less than\n- `>=` Greater than or equal\n- `<=` Less than or equal\n\n### Example\n\nTo find customers from the USA:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'USA';\n```\n\nStrings must be enclosed in single quotes.",
